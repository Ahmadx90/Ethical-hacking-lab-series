# Ethical-hacking-lab-series
Hands-on network security labs covering enumeration, exploitation (EternalBlue, buffer overflows), malware analysis, web app testing, compliance scanning, and SIEM monitoring ‚Äî using tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, SQLMap, Cuckoo Sandbox, and Wazuh.

# üîê Network Security Labs ‚Äì A Comprehensive Cybersecurity Simulation

This repository presents a broad collection of practical labs simulating real-world cybersecurity scenarios, executed within a controlled and isolated virtual environment. The work spans multiple security domains, from enumeration and exploitation to malware analysis, compliance scanning, and SIEM integration‚Äîreflecting the complete lifecycle of a professional red team/blue team engagement.

---

## üìñ Overview

These labs were conducted to build hands-on proficiency in offensive and defensive security. The exercises include identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting weaknesses, analyzing malicious behavior, testing web applications, and monitoring threats. Each topic aligns with core principles in penetration testing, vulnerability management, incident response, and system hardening.

Rather than focus on one isolated technique or attack vector, the project brings together a **multi-layered security perspective**. The tasks simulate reconnaissance, attack execution, privilege escalation, and defense assessment‚Äîmirroring the steps of a professional penetration test and security audit.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Lab Environment

All labs were performed using multiple virtual machines running on VMware Workstation. The systems used for testing include:

| System             | Role/Function            |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Kali Linux         | Attacker/Toolkit OS      |
| Metasploitable 2/3 | Vulnerable Linux Hosts   |
| Windows XP         | Legacy Target OS         |
| Windows 7          | Mid-generation Target OS |
| Windows 10         | Modern Target OS         |
| Ubuntu             | Linux Server Simulation  |
